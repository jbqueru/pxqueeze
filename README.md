## Security (including CRA)

The code in this project is meant to be used in the process of
creating demos and/or games for old computers and/or video game
consoles, with the understanding that the security features on
such hardware and the bundled software, if any, are typically
grossly inappropriate by modern standards.
The code in this project should be considered a research project
within that context.
In other words: **don't even think of using this code in a way
that faces the Internet and/or processes arbitrary user data,
that's not what it's meant for.**

None of the code in this project involves any direct or indirect

project, nor have any donations been accepted in connection
with this project. The author has no intention of charging a
price for this code. They also do not intend to accept donations,
but acknowledge that, in extreme situations, donations of
hardware or of access to hardware might facilitate development,
without any intent to make a profit.
